📊 Sales Data Analysis & Dashboard Project

🔍 Project Overview

This is an end-to-end Data Analyst project where I analyzed sales data using SQL concepts, Python (Pandas, Matplotlib) and built an interactive dashboard using Tableau.

The goal of this project is to extract business insights such as:

- Revenue trends over time

- Top-performing products

- Category-wise sales contribution

- Monthly sales performance

🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
Python: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib

- Jupyter Notebook: Data cleaning & analysis

- SQL Concepts: Aggregations, joins, filtering (implemented via Pandas)

- Tableau Public: Dashboard & visualizations

- GitHub: Project version control

📂 Dataset Description

- orders.csv – Order-level sales data (date, product, quantity, revenue)

- products.csv – Product and category information

📈 Key Analysis Performed

- Data cleaning and preprocessing

- Monthly sales trend analysis

- Top 10 products by total revenue

- Category-wise sales contribution

- Business insights from visualizations

📊 Dashboard Preview


📌 Key Business Insights
- Sales show a clear monthly trend with peak performance in specific months

- A small number of products contribute to a large portion of total revenue

- Certain categories consistently outperform others

- Removing incomplete months avoids misleading trends

🚀 How to Run This Project

- Clone the repository

- Open sales_analysis.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook

- Run cells sequentially

- Open Tableau and connect the CSV files to recreate the dashboard

🎯## Why This Project Matters

- This project demonstrates:

- End-to-end data analysis workflow

- Business-oriented thinking

- Ability to communicate insights visually

- Readiness for Data Analyst Intern / Entry-Level roles
